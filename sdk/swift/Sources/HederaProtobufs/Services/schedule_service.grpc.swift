/// Transactions and queries for the Schedule Service
///
/// The Schedule Service allows transactions to be submitted without all the required signatures and
/// allows anyone to provide the required signatures independently after a transaction has already
/// been created. The transactions can be executed immediately when all required signatures are received
/// or at a future date if Long Term Scheduled Transactions are enabled.
///
/// Execution:
///
/// Scheduled Transactions are executed in two different modes.
///
/// 1. If Long Term Scheduled Transactions are enabled and <tt>wait_for_expiry</tt> was set to <tt>true</tt> on the
///    <tt>ScheduleCreate</tt>, then the transaction will be executed at the <tt>expiration_time</tt> specified on the
///    <tt>ScheduleCreate</tt>.
///
/// 2. Otherwise Scheduled Transactions are executed once all required signatures are collected and witnessed.
///    Every time new signature is provided, a check is performed on the "readiness" of the execution.
///    The Scheduled Transaction will be executed immediately after the transaction that triggered it.
///
/// NOTICE:
/// A Scheduled Transaction being ready to execute, or even not ready to execute, at the time a <tt>ScheduleCreate</tt> or
/// <tt>ScheduleSign</tt> comes in does not guarantee it will stay that way. Any number of things can happen over time that
/// impact the transaction.
///
/// For example, account keys can change, accounts can be deleted, and account balances can change.
///
/// A particularly noteworthy case is if Long Term Scheduled Transactions are enabled and signature requirements for a Scheduled
/// Transaction change such that existing signatures become sufficient to allow the transaction to go through. In this case the transaction
/// will execute at expiration_time unless a ScheduleSign comes in to push it through.
///
/// Transaction Record:
///
/// If a Scheduled Transaction is executed immediately following the transaction that provided all required signatures,
/// the timestamp of the Scheduled Transaction will be equal to consensusTimestamp + 1 nano, where
/// consensusTimestamp is the timestamp of the transaction that triggered the execution.
///
/// The Transaction ID of the Scheduled Transaction will have the scheduled property set to true and
/// inherit the <tt>transactionValidStart</tt> and <tt>accountID</tt> from the <tt>ScheduleCreate</tt> transaction.
///
/// The <tt>scheduleRef</tt> property of the transaction record will be populated with the <tt>ScheduleID</tt> of the
/// Scheduled Transaction.
///
/// Post execution:
///
/// After execution, a Scheduled Transaction will remain in state and can be queried using <tt>GetScheduleInfo</tt> until expiration.
///
/// Expiry:
///
/// The expiration time of a schedule is controlled by it's <tt>expiration_time</tt>. If Long Term Scheduled Transactions are disabled,
/// the <tt>expiration_time</tt> is always 30 minutes in the future.
///
/// Once a given Scheduled Transaction expires, it will be removed from the ledger and any upcoming
/// operation referring the ScheduleID will resolve to INVALID_SCHEDULE_ID.
