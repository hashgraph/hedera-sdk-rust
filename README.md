- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)

Clone this repository and its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-rust.git

```

Update [`\protobufs`](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node.git) submodule to recent version (if necessary):

### Examples

To the run an example, set an operator id and operator key in the `.env` file. By default, these run against testnet.

```bash
# Account that will pay query and transaction fees.
OPERATOR_ID=
# Default private key to use to sign for all transactions and queries.
OPERATOR_KEY=
```

Cargo Command:
```bash
cargo run --release --example <EXAMPLE_FILENAME>
```

Create Account Example: 
```bash
cargo run --release --example create_account
```


### Tests

Before running the integration tests, an operator key, operator id, and a network name must be set in an `.env` file.

```bash
# Account that will pay query and transaction fees.
TEST_OPERATOR_ID=
# Default private key to use to sign for all transactions and queries.
TEST_OPERATOR_KEY=
# Network names: "localhost", "testnet", "previewnet", "mainnet".
TEST_NETWORK_NAME=
# Running on-chain tests if this value is set to 1.
TEST_RUN_NONFREE=
```

Run the tests using `cargo test`

```bash
# Run all tests (unit and integration tests)
cargo test

# Run specific tests in a module
cargo test <MODULE_NAME>::<FILE_NAME>::<FUNCTION_NAME>
```

e.g.
```bash
# Run account module tests
cargo test account
# Run account module tests in file
cargo test account::create
# Run a single test
cargo test account::create::initial_balance_and_key
```

#### Local Environment Testing

Hedera offers a way to run tests through your localhost using the `hedera-local-node` service.

For instructions on how to set up and run local node, follow the steps in the git repository:
<https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-local-node>

Once the local node is running in Docker, use these environment variables in the `.env`.

```bash
# Account that will pay query and transaction fees.
TEST_OPERATOR_ID=0.0.2
# Default private key to use to sign for all transactions and queries.
TEST_OPERATOR_KEY=302e020100300506032b65700422042091132178e72057a1d7528025956fe39b0b847f200ab59b2fdd367017f3087137
# Network names: "localhost", "testnet", "previewnet", "mainnet".
TEST_NETWORK_NAME=localhost
# Running on-chain tests if this value is set to 1.
TEST_RUN_NONFREE=1
```

Lastly, run the tests using `cargo test`
