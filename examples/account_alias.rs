    // Hedera supports a form of auto account creation.
    //
    // You can "create" an account by generating a private key, and then deriving the public key,
    // without any need to interact with the Hedera network.  The public key more or less acts as the user's
    // account ID.  This public key is an account's alias_key: a public key that aliases (or will eventually alias)
    // to a Hedera account.
    //
    // An AccountId takes one of two forms: a normal `AccountId` with no `alias_key` takes the form 0.0.123,
    // while an account ID with an `alias_key` takes the form
    // 0.0.302a300506032b6570032100114e6abc371b82dab5c15ea149f02d34a012087b163516dd70f44acafabf7777
    // Note the prefix of "0.0." indicating the shard and realm.  Also note that the aliasKey is stringified
    // as a hex-encoded ASN1 DER representation of the key.
    //
    // An AccountId with an aliasKey can be used just like a normal AccountId for the purposes of queries and
    // transactions, however most queries and transactions involving such an AccountId won't work until Hbar has
    // been transferred to the alias_key account.
    //
    // There is no record in the Hedera network of an account associated with a given `alias_key`
    // until an amount of Hbar is transferred to the account.  The moment that Hbar is transferred to that `alias_key`
    // AccountId is the moment that that account actually begins to exist in the Hedera ledger.
